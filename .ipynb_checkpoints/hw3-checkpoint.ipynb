Specifically, age and education number appear more evenly distributed compared to other features, suggesting they may serve as stronger predictors for income. In contrast, the distribution for capital gain and capital loss are highly skewed, with most values clustered at zero, indicating that they may contribute less on their own and would likely need to be evaluated alongside other features."
